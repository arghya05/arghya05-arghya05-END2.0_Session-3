# arghya05-arghya05-END2.0_Session-3

Write a neural network that can:
take 2 inputs:
an image from MNIST dataset, and
a random number between 0 and 9
and gives two outputs:
the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image, and
the "sum" of this number with the random number that was generated and sent as the input to the network
assign.png     
you can mix fully connected layers and convolution layers
you can use one-hot encoding to represent the random number input as well as the "summed" output. 
Your code MUST be:
well documented (via readme file on github and comments in the code)
must mention the data representation
must mention your data generation strategy
must mention how you have combined the two inputs
must mention how you are evaluating your results
must mention "what" results you finally got and how did you evaluate your results
must mention what loss function you picked and why!
training MUST happen on the GPU
